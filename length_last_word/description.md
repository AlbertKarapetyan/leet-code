A **word** is defined as a maximal substring consisting of **non-space characters only**.

## üß© Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be **at least one word** in `s`.

## ‚úÖ Tips
To solve this, you can:
- Use `str.strip()` to remove leading/trailing spaces.
- Use `str.split()` to split the string into words.
- Return the length of the last word.
